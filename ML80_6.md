# ML80-6: Magnetic Loop Antenna System

## 80 m through 6 m — 3/8" Copper Tube Radiator & Coupling Loop

### Design Overview

A single magnetic loop cannot efficiently span 80 m to 6 m (3.5–54 MHz, a
15:1 frequency ratio). The loop circumference must stay between ~0.04 λ and
~0.25 λ for proper magnetic-loop behaviour. This design uses **two
interchangeable main loops** sharing a common mount and feed system:

| Element | Diameter | Bands Covered |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Loop A** (large) | 1.00 m (3.3 ft) | 80 m – 15 m |
| **Loop B** (small) | 0.40 m (16 in) | 12 m – 6 m |

Both main loops and both coupling loops are formed from **3/8" (9.525 mm)
OD soft-temper copper tube**.

The coupling loop sits at the bottom of the main loop, diametrically opposite
the tuning capacitor. Both loops lie in the same plane.

## Loop A — 80 m through 15 m

### Physical Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Main loop diameter | 1.00 m (3.28 ft) |
| Main loop circumference | 3.14 m (10.3 ft) |
| Tube OD / wall | 3/8" (9.525 mm) Type L soft |
| Loop inductance | 2.97 μH |
| Loop area | 0.785 m² |
| Coupling loop diameter | 200 mm (8 in) — 1/5 ratio |
| Coupling loop circumference | 628 mm (2.1 ft) |

### Performance Table (Loop A)

| Band | Freq (MHz) | C_tune (pF) | Circ / λ | Efficiency | Eff (dB) | −3 dB BW | Q | V_cap @ 100 W |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|----------|----------|------|---------------|
| 80 m | 3.55 | 676 | 0.037 | 0.7 % | −21.4 | 2.8 kHz | 1276 | 2 900 V |
| 60 m | 5.35 | 298 | 0.056 | 3.0 % | −15.3 | 3.5 kHz | 1538 | 3 900 V |
| 40 m | 7.10 | 169 | 0.074 | 7.6 % | −11.2 | 4.2 kHz | 1678 | 4 700 V |
| 30 m | 10.1 | 83 | 0.106 | 22 % | −6.5 | 6.0 kHz | 1689 | 5 700 V |
| 20 m | 14.2 | 43 | 0.148 | 48 % | −3.2 | 10.6 kHz | 1331 | 5 900 V |
| 17 m | 18.1 | 26 | 0.189 | 69 % | −1.6 | 20 kHz | 909 | 5 500 V |
| 15 m | 21.2 | 19 | 0.222 | 79 % | −1.0 | 33 kHz | 652 | 5 100 V |

> **Notes on 80 m / 60 m:** Efficiency is very low at these bands — this is
> a fundamental limitation of any sub-wavelength loop. On 80 m the antenna is
> only 0.037 λ in circumference. Useful for **receive** and **QRP CW**, but
> do not expect competitive signal reports. Performance improves dramatically
> from 30 m upward.

### Tuning Capacitor — Loop A

Required range: **19 pF** (15 m) to **676 pF** (80 m).

**Recommended:** Vacuum variable capacitor 5–500 pF (e.g. Jennings UCSL-500
or surplus equivalent) **plus** a relay-switched 200 pF / 5 kV fixed
doorknob capacitor in parallel.

| Config | Total C range | Bands |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Vacuum var only | 5 – 500 pF | 15 m, 17 m, 20 m, 30 m, 40 m |
| Vacuum var + 200 pF fixed | 205 – 700 pF | 60 m, 80 m |

The relay must be a vacuum relay or high-voltage reed relay (≥ 7 kV rating).

**QRP alternative (≤ 5 W):** A butterfly / split-stator air variable capacitor
with ≥ 1 mm plate spacing can handle the ~1 300 V peak at 5 W. Two ganged
capacitors (one large, one small) can cover the full range.

## Loop B — 12 m through 6 m

### Physical Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Main loop diameter | 0.40 m (15.7 in) |
| Main loop circumference | 1.26 m (4.1 ft) |
| Tube OD / wall | 3/8" (9.525 mm) Type L soft |
| Loop inductance | 0.96 μH |
| Loop area | 0.126 m² |
| Coupling loop diameter | 100 mm (4 in) — 1/4 ratio |
| Coupling loop circumference | 314 mm (1.0 ft) |

> The coupling loop is 1/4 (not 1/5) of the main loop diameter because 1/5
> (80 mm) approaches the minimum bending radius of 3/8" tube.

### Performance Table (Loop B)

| Band | Freq (MHz) | C_tune (pF) | Circ / λ | Efficiency | Eff (dB) | −3 dB BW | Q | V_cap @ 100 W |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|----------|----------|------|---------------|
| 12 m | 24.9 | 42 | 0.105 | 30 % | −5.2 | 12.9 kHz | 1928 | 5 400 V |
| 10 m | 28.5 | 33 | 0.119 | 41 % | −3.9 | 16.4 kHz | 1735 | 5 500 V |
| 6 m | 50.1 | 11 | 0.210 | 83 % | −0.8 | 76 kHz | 655 | 4 400 V |

### Tuning Capacitor — Loop B

Required range: **11 pF** (6 m) to **42 pF** (12 m).

A small **butterfly / split-stator air variable capacitor** (5–50 pF) with
≥ 1.5 mm plate spacing handles this range. No supplementary fixed capacitor
is needed.

For 100 W operation, plate spacing must withstand 5 500 V peak — use a
vacuum variable or wide-gap air variable. For QRP (≤ 5 W), voltages drop to
~1 200 V, manageable with standard butterfly capacitors.

## Power Handling Summary

| Power | Peak V_cap (worst case) | Capacitor Type Required |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 100 W | 5 900 V (Loop A, 20 m) | Vacuum variable |
| 25 W | 2 950 V | Vacuum variable or wide-gap (≥ 3 mm) air |
| 10 W | 1 870 V | High-quality air variable, ≥ 2 mm gap |
| 5 W | 1 320 V | Butterfly / split-stator, ≥ 1 mm gap |

> V_cap scales as √P. Halving power reduces voltage by 30 %.

## Coupling Loop Details

Both coupling loops are formed from 3/8" copper tube, bent into a circle
and mounted at the bottom of the main loop, co-planar and centred.

| Coupling Loop | Diameter | Tube Length | Ratio to Main |
|--------------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Loop A feed | 200 mm (8 in) | 630 mm | 1 : 5 |
| Loop B feed | 100 mm (4 in) | 315 mm | 1 : 4 |

**Feed connection:** Solder the coax shield to one end of the coupling loop
tube, and the coax centre conductor to the other end. Mount an SO-239 or BNC
bulkhead connector at the bottom centre for a clean coax transition.

Alternatively, use a Faraday-shielded coupling loop (slot the outer tube,
insulate the gap) for a more balanced feed and reduced common-mode current.

---

## Calculation Basis

All values are derived from standard magnetic loop equations:

```
Loop inductance:    L  = μ₀ × R × [ ln(8R/a) − 2 ]
Resonant cap:       C  = 1 / (4π²f²L)
Radiation resistance: Rr = 31171 × (A / λ²)²
Surface resistance:  Rs = √(π f μ₀ / σ_Cu)
Loss resistance:    Rl = Rs × circumference / (π × tube_OD)
Efficiency:         η  = Rr / (Rr + Rl)
Quality factor:     Q  = 2πfL / (Rr + Rl)
Bandwidth (−3 dB):  BW = f / Q
Cap voltage:        Vc = √(P × 2πfL × Q)
```

Where: R = loop radius, a = tube radius (4.76 mm), σ_Cu = 5.8 × 10⁷ S/m,
A = loop area, λ = wavelength.

Capacitor and joint losses are not included — real-world efficiency will be
somewhat lower, especially if connections are not soldered.

## Construction Notes

1. **Forming the loops.** Anneal the tube first (heat cherry-red, quench).
   Use a circular form (bucket, wheel rim, etc.) or bend into an 8-sided
   octagon for easier construction — performance difference is negligible.
   Leave a **15 mm gap** at the top for the capacitor terminals.

2. **Solder all joints.** Use silver solder (not plumber's solder) for low
   resistance. Every milliohm of joint resistance degrades efficiency. Avoid
   mechanical-only connections (clamps, set screws) at high-current points.

3. **Capacitor mounting.** Mount the variable capacitor across the gap at the
   top of the loop. Keep leads as short as possible (< 10 mm). Use copper
   straps, not wire.

4. **Coupling loop position.** The coupling loop sits at the 6 o'clock
   position inside the main loop, centred and co-planar. It is **not**
   electrically connected to the main loop. Adjust the coupling loop position
   (slightly in/out of the main loop plane) for best SWR match.

5. **Support structure.** Use a PVC or fibreglass mast and clamps. Keep all
   metal (except the antenna) at least 0.5 m away from the loop. The loop
   should be mounted at least 1 m above ground for best radiation pattern.

6. **Weatherproofing.** Coat the capacitor area with conformal spray. Use a
   plastic housing over the capacitor if the antenna will be outdoors. The
   copper tube itself weathers well and develops a protective patina.

7. **Tuning.** The antenna is **extremely narrowband** (2–33 kHz depending on
   band). A stepper motor driving the capacitor shaft is highly recommended
   for comfortable operation. Retune whenever you change frequency by more
   than a few kHz on the lower bands.

## Operating Guidelines

| Band | Mode Suitability | Retune Interval |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 80 m | CW/QRP receive only (0.7% eff.) | Every 1–2 kHz |
| 60 m | CW/QRP (3% eff.) | Every 2 kHz |
| 40 m | CW, narrow SSB (8% eff.) | Every 3 kHz |
| 30 m | CW, digital (22% eff.) | Every 5 kHz |
| 20 m | All modes (48% eff.) | Every 8 kHz |
| 17 m | All modes (69% eff.) | Every 15 kHz |
| 15 m | All modes (79% eff.) | Every 25 kHz |
| 12 m | All modes (30% eff.) | Every 10 kHz |
| 10 m | All modes (41% eff.) | Every 12 kHz |
| 6 m | All modes inc. FM (83% eff.) | Every 50 kHz |

> Magnetic loop antennas are **very quiet on receive** due to their small
> aperture — they reject much of the local electrical noise that plagues
> wire antennas. Even on 80 m where TX efficiency is poor, the loop can be
> an excellent receiving antenna.

## Design Limitations

- **80 m and 60 m efficiency is poor.** This is physics, not a design flaw.
  A 1.0 m loop is only 0.037 λ at 3.5 MHz. For serious 80 m work, a full-
  size loop of 3+ m diameter (requiring heavier tubing) is needed.
- **Very narrow bandwidth** requires motor-driven tuning for practical use.
- **High capacitor voltage** at 100 W mandates a vacuum variable capacitor.
  QRP operation (≤ 5 W) greatly relaxes this requirement.
- **Nearby metal objects** detune the antenna and reduce efficiency. Maintain
  clearance of at least 0.5 m from any conductive surfaces.
