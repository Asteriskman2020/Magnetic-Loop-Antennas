# ML20_6 — Magnetic Loop Antenna: 20 m – 6 m

> **Two-loop general-purpose design | 3/8" copper tube | 10 W max**

---

## 1. Design Overview

A two-loop interchangeable magnetic loop antenna system covering the 20 m
through 6 m amateur bands (14–54 MHz). This is a balanced design optimising
for a practical trade-off between efficiency, physical size, and cost.

| Parameter          | Value                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Band coverage      | 20 m, 17 m, 15 m, 12 m, 10 m, 6 m        |
| Frequency range    | 14.000 – 54.000 MHz                        |
| Max power          | 10 W                                       |
| Radiator material  | 3/8" (9.525 mm OD) soft copper tube Type L |
| Coupling loop      | 3/8" soft copper tube                      |
| Number of loops    | 2 (interchangeable)                        |
| Loop 1 (HF)       | 0.80 m diameter — 20 m, 17 m, 15 m, 12 m, 10 m |
| Loop 2 (VHF)      | 0.44 m diameter — 6 m                      |

**Design rationale:** A single loop cannot cover 14–54 MHz while keeping
circumference/λ within the 0.04–0.25 operating range. The 0.80 m loop is
sized so that circ/λ reaches 0.249 at the top of 10 m (29.7 MHz), extracting
maximum radiation resistance from the larger loop across five HF bands. A
dedicated 0.44 m loop handles 6 m where circ/λ = 0.24, giving excellent
efficiency on VHF.

## 5. Theoretical Maximum Efficiency (Lossless Capacitor)

For reference — efficiency with a perfect (infinite-Q) tuning capacitor,
showing the copper-loss-only limit:

| Band | Rr (mΩ) | Rl (mΩ) | η_max (%) |
|------|----------|----------|-----------|
| 20 m | 39.4  | 82.5  | 32.3 |
| 17 m | 105.0 | 93.2  | 53.0 |
| 15 m | 197.7 | 100.9 | 66.2 |
| 12 m | 377.3 | 109.4 | 77.5 |
| 10 m | 676.2 | 117.6 | 85.2 |
| 6 m  | 653.0 | 86.9  | 88.3 |

> Copper loss alone limits 20 m to 32 % — a fundamental constraint of
> the 0.80 m loop diameter at 14 MHz. Higher efficiency on 20 m would
> require a physically larger loop.

## 6. Tuning Capacitors

### 6.1 Loop 1 — Air Variable Capacitor

| Parameter          | Value                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Required range     | 13.4 – 55.6 pF                |
| Recommended type   | Air variable, 10–100 pF       |
| Plate spacing      | ≥ 1.5 mm (for 1 500 V rating) |
| Q at HF            | ≈ 2 000 – 3 000               |
| Mounting           | Insulated at top of loop       |
| Tuning drive       | 6:1 reduction vernier drive    |

**Selection notes:**
- A 10–100 pF air variable provides adequate range with room for stray
  capacitance (typically 2–5 pF from wiring and mounting hardware)
- At 10 m, required C = 13.4 pF; stray capacitance of ~3 pF means the
  variable needs to be set to ~10 pF — verify your capacitor reaches this
  low value
- Plate spacing of 1.5 mm handles the 1 426 V peak with 50 % safety margin
  (air breakdown ≈ 3 kV/mm)
- A 6:1 vernier reduction drive is essential — the loop's narrow bandwidth
  (15–70 kHz) demands precise tuning

**Upgrade option:** A butterfly (split-stator) 2 × 100 pF capacitor
provides 0–50 pF effective range with no wiping contacts. This raises
Q to 3 000–5 000 and improves efficiency by 5–15 percentage points
across all bands. Doubled voltage rating (each section sees half the
total voltage) adds a large safety margin.

### 6.2 Loop 2 — Small Air Variable or Piston Trimmer

| Parameter          | Value                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| Required range     | 8.0 – 9.4 pF (50–54 MHz)      |
| Recommended type   | Miniature air variable, 3–25 pF|
| Alternative        | Ceramic piston trimmer, 2–22 pF|
| Q at 52 MHz        | ≈ 1 500 – 2 500               |
| Mounting           | Insulated at top of loop       |

**Selection notes:**
- The 6 m loop only needs to cover 50–54 MHz, so the tuning range is
  tiny: 8.0–9.4 pF (only 1.4 pF variation)
- A miniature air variable (3–25 pF) with a knob provides easy tuning
  across the full 6 m band
- A ceramic piston trimmer is cheaper but requires a screwdriver to adjust
- Stray capacitance may account for much of the required 8–9 pF; in
  practice you may need to add a 5–8 pF fixed capacitor in parallel if
  the variable cannot reach the target with stray alone

## 7. Coupling Loops

Both coupling loops use 3/8" (9.525 mm) soft copper tube, bent into
circles and positioned at the bottom of their respective main loops,
diametrically opposite the tuning capacitor.

### 7.1 Loop 1 Coupling Loop

| Parameter            | Value                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Diameter             | 160 mm (1:5 ratio)       |
| Circumference        | 503 mm                   |
| Tube length required | ≈ 550 mm (incl. pigtails)|
| Impedance target     | 50 Ω                     |
| Connector            | SO-239 or BNC            |

### 7.2 Loop 2 Coupling Loop

| Parameter            | Value                    |
|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Diameter             | 110 mm (1:4 ratio)       |
| Circumference        | 346 mm                   |
| Tube length required | ≈ 400 mm (incl. pigtails)|
| Impedance target     | 50 Ω                     |
| Connector            | SO-239 or BNC            |

> **Note:** Loop 2's coupling ratio is 1:4 (not the usual 1:5) because
> the 3/8" tube's minimum bend radius of 38 mm limits how small the
> coupling loop can be. A 110 mm diameter gives a comfortable bend with
> no risk of tube kinking.

### Coupling Loop Termination

- Solder the tube ends to the SO-239 connector
- Keep the gap between tube ends at 10–15 mm
- Centre conductor to one tube end, shield to the other
- Use 56 % silver solder for lowest joint resistance

### 8.2 Support Structure

| Component             | Material / Size            |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Vertical mast         | 1" Schedule 40 PVC, 1.2 m  |
| Base                  | PVC cross-fitting or tripod |
| Loop clamp (top)      | PVC saddle clamp or nylon U-bolt |
| Loop clamp (bottom)   | PVC saddle clamp or zip ties |
| Capacitor box         | Small ABS project box at loop top |

- Mount the tuning capacitor in a small project box at the top of
  the loop with the shaft protruding for the vernier drive knob
- The coupling loop sits at the bottom of the main loop, attached to
  the mast with zip ties or small clamps
- All fasteners must be non-metallic (nylon, plastic) within 30 cm
  of the loop to avoid parasitic coupling

### 8.3 Loop Forming

The 0.80 m loop is formed by bending the 3/8" soft copper tube around a
circular jig (e.g. a 5-gallon bucket or plywood template):

1. Cut tube to 2.55 m
2. Fill with dry sand or use a tube bender to prevent kinking
3. Form into a circle of 0.80 m diameter
4. Leave a 15–20 mm gap at the top for capacitor connection
5. Clean tube ends with fine emery cloth
6. Tin tube ends with 56 % silver solder

The 0.44 m loop follows the same process with 1.42 m of tube.

## 10. Assembly Procedure

### Step 1 — Form the Main Loops
1. Cut 2.55 m of tube for Loop 1 (0.80 m)
2. Cut 1.42 m of tube for Loop 2 (0.44 m)
3. Fill each tube with fine dry sand, plug ends with tape
4. Bend each around a circular form of the correct diameter
5. Empty sand, clean inside with compressed air

### Step 2 — Form the Coupling Loops
1. Cut 0.55 m for Loop 1 coupling (160 mm dia.)
2. Cut 0.40 m for Loop 2 coupling (110 mm dia.)
3. Bend into circles using a round form (coffee can, PVC coupling)
4. Leave 10–15 mm gap between tube ends

### Step 3 — Solder Connections
1. Clean all joint surfaces with emery cloth
2. Apply silver solder flux
3. Solder coupling loop ends to SO-239 connectors
4. Solder main loop ends to capacitor mounting tabs
5. Use 56 % silver solder throughout — do NOT use lead-tin solder

### Step 4 — Mount Components
1. Install capacitor in project box at loop top
2. Attach vernier drive to capacitor shaft
3. Mount coupling loop at bottom of main loop with zip ties
4. Secure main loop to PVC mast with nylon U-bolts or saddle clamps
5. Route coax from coupling loop SO-239 down the mast

### Step 5 — Test and Tune
1. Connect antenna analyser or NanoVNA to coupling loop
2. Tune capacitor to find resonance on each band
3. Adjust coupling loop position (rotate slightly, move up/down) to
   achieve SWR < 1.5:1 at resonance
4. Mark capacitor dial positions for each band

## 11. Operating Notes

### Tuning Procedure
1. Set transceiver to desired frequency
2. Select appropriate loop (Loop 1 for 20–10 m, Loop 2 for 6 m)
3. Transmit carrier into loop at low power (1–2 W)
4. Slowly adjust tuning capacitor for minimum SWR
5. The null is extremely sharp — use the vernier drive carefully
6. Increase power to operating level (max 10 W)

### Bandwidth and Retuning
- On 20 m (BW 15.7 kHz): retune every 10–15 kHz
- On 10 m (BW 70 kHz): covers most of a band segment
- On 6 m (BW 135 kHz): covers SSB/CW segment without retuning
- SWR 2:1 bandwidth ≈ 60 % of the listed −3 dB bandwidth

### Safety
- **RF burns:** At 10 W, peak capacitor voltage reaches 1 426 V.
  Never touch the tuning capacitor or the top of the loop during
  transmit. Even at 10 W, RF burns from the high-voltage points
  are possible.
- **Body proximity:** Stay at least 0.5 m from the loop during transmit.
  Body capacitance detunes the antenna and absorbs RF energy.
- **Mechanical:** The 0.80 m loop is large enough to be unwieldy in wind.
  Ensure the base is weighted or staked in field use.

### Performance Tips
- Mount the loop as high as practical — even 1 m above ground helps
- Keep the loop away from metal objects (fences, gutters, vehicles)
- For best DX, orient the loop so the null points (broadside) face away
  from the desired direction; maximum radiation is off the loop edges
- A ground plane or radials are NOT needed — the loop is a balanced
  radiator with negligible ground current

## 12. Comparison with ML20_6_Efficiency

The companion design **ML20_6_Efficiency.md** uses a single 0.44 m loop
with a high-Q butterfly capacitor to cover 20 m – 6 m. Key differences:

| Aspect | ML20_6 (this design) | ML20_6_Efficiency |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Loops | 2 (0.80 m + 0.44 m) | 1 (0.44 m) |
| 20 m efficiency | 17.7 % | 5.3 % |
| 10 m efficiency | 67.7 % | 55.3 % |
| 6 m efficiency | 71.3 % | 79.0 % |
| Average efficiency | 48.3 % | 36.5 % |
| Physical size | 31.5" max | 17.3" max |
| Portability | Moderate | Excellent |
| Cost | ~$124 | ~$77 |
| Complexity | 2 loops, swap coax | Single loop, no swap |

> **Verdict:** This 2-loop design outperforms the single-loop
> efficiency design on every HF band (20–10 m) by 12–25 percentage
> points, at the cost of greater size and complexity. Choose this
> design for home station or semi-portable use. Choose ML20_6_Efficiency
> for backpack-portable operation where size is the priority.
