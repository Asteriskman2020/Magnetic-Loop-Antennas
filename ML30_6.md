# ML30-6: Efficiency-Optimized Magnetic Loop Antenna

## 30 m through 6 m — 10 W Max — 3/8" Copper Tube

### Design Philosophy

This design **maximizes efficiency** by sizing each loop so its circumference
stays between 0.10 λ and 0.25 λ across every band it serves. A single loop
can only maintain this ratio over about a 2.5:1 frequency range, so three
loops are used. Each loop diameter is chosen to push circumference / λ as
close to 0.25 as possible at its highest operating frequency.

The 10 W power limit keeps capacitor voltages below 2 000 V on all bands,
eliminating the need for expensive vacuum variable capacitors. Standard
air-spaced or butterfly capacitors work throughout.

### System Architecture

```
   Band:   30m ──── 20m          17m ── 15m ── 12m ── 10m          6m
   Loop:   ═══ Loop A ═══       ══════ Loop B ══════════       ═══ Loop C ═══
   Dia:      1.60 m                   0.85 m                     0.44 m
   Circ/λ: 0.17─0.24            0.16─────────────0.25           0.23
```

| Loop | Diameter | Circumference | Bands | Circ / λ range |
|------|----------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| **A** | 1.60 m (5.2 ft) | 5.03 m | 30 m, 20 m | 0.170 – 0.238 |
| **B** | 0.85 m (33.5 in) | 2.67 m | 17 m, 15 m, 12 m, 10 m | 0.161 – 0.254 |
| **C** | 0.44 m (17.3 in) | 1.38 m | 6 m | 0.231 |

**Why these diameters?**
- Loop A: 1.60 m is the **largest circle that stays below 0.25 λ at 20 m**
  (14.35 MHz). This maximizes 30 m efficiency.
- Loop B: 0.85 m is the **largest circle that stays at 0.25 λ at 10 m**
  (28 MHz). This covers four WARC + contest bands at high efficiency.
- Loop C: 0.44 m is the **largest circle under 0.25 λ at 54 MHz** (top of
  6 m). Dedicated loop for maximum VHF efficiency.

> limit of 3/8" tube. At 110 mm diameter the bend radius is 55 mm — safe.

### Performance

| Band | Freq (MHz) | C (pF) | Circ/λ | Rr (mΩ) | Rloss (mΩ) | η (%) | dB | BW (kHz) | Q | Vcap (V) | ERP (W) |

## All-Band Summary

| Band | Loop | Freq | Efficiency | Loss | −3 dB BW | ERP @ 10 W | vs Dipole |
|------|------|------|-----------|------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 30 m | A | 10.1 MHz | **54 %** | −2.7 dB | 9.2 kHz | 5.4 W | < ½ S-unit |
| 20 m | A | 14.2 MHz | **79 %** | −1.0 dB | 24.2 kHz | 7.9 W | negligible |
| 17 m | B | 18.1 MHz | **57 %** | −2.4 dB | 15.1 kHz | 5.7 W | < ½ S-unit |
| 15 m | B | 21.2 MHz | **70 %** | −1.5 dB | 23.4 kHz | 7.0 W | ¼ S-unit |
| 12 m | B | 24.9 MHz | **81 %** | −0.9 dB | 38.8 kHz | 8.1 W | negligible |
| 10 m | B | 28.5 MHz | **87 %** | −0.6 dB | 61.3 kHz | 8.7 W | negligible |
| 6 m | C | 50.1 MHz | **87 %** | −0.6 dB | 95.1 kHz | 8.7 W | negligible |

**Average efficiency: 74 %.** Five of seven bands exceed 70 %.
Worst case is 30 m at 54 % (−2.7 dB) — still only half an S-unit below a
dipole and delivering 5.4 W ERP.

## Power Handling at 10 W

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Max voltage across capacitor | 1 913 V (Loop A, 30 m) |
| Min plate gap for air cap | 2 mm (provides ~3 kV breakdown margin) |
| Capacitor type | Air-spaced variable or butterfly — NO vacuum needed |
| Max circulating current | 5.7 A (Loop A, 30 m) |

The 10 W limit is the key design enabler:
- Voltages stay below 2 kV → standard air capacitors work
- Currents stay below 6 A → solder joints are not stressed
- No vacuum variables, no HV relays, no exotic parts

At **5 W** (typical QRP): all voltages drop to under 1 350 V. Even small
trimmer capacitors can handle this.

## Coupling Loop Details

| Loop | Coupling Dia | Tube Length | Ratio | Connector |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| A | 320 mm (12.6 in) | 1 005 mm | 1 : 5 | SO-239 |
| B | 170 mm (6.7 in) | 534 mm | 1 : 5 | BNC |
| C | 110 mm (4.3 in) | 346 mm | 1 : 4 | BNC |

All coupling loops are 3/8" copper tube, co-planar with and centred inside
the main loop at the 6 o'clock position (opposite the capacitor).

**Feed:** Solder the coax shield to one tube end, centre conductor to the
other. Mount a panel-mount connector at the bottom of the coupling loop.

**Matching adjustment:** Tilt or slide the coupling loop to adjust the
50 Ω match:
- Move **inward** (closer to main loop plane) → increases coupling → lower Z
- Move **outward** (away from plane) → decreases coupling → higher Z
- Target: SWR < 1.5:1 at the most-used frequency

## Calculation Basis

```
Inductance:         L  = μ₀ R [ ln(8R/a) − 2 ]
Capacitance:        C  = 1 / (4π²f²L)
Radiation resistance: Rr = 31171 (A/λ²)²
Surface resistance:  Rs = √(πfμ₀ / σ_Cu)
Loss resistance:    Rl = Rs × circumference / (π × tube_OD)
Efficiency:         η  = Rr / (Rr + Rl)
Q factor:           Q  = 2πfL / (Rr + Rl)
Bandwidth:          BW = f / Q
Cap voltage:        Vc = I × X_L,   I = √(P_in / R_total)
ERP:                ERP = P_in × η
```

Constants: a = 4.76 mm (tube radius), σ_Cu = 5.8 × 10⁷ S/m,
μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m. Capacitor and joint losses not included.

## Construction Notes

### Efficiency-Critical Practices

1. **Silver-solder every joint.** Use 56 % silver brazing alloy (Harris
   Safety-Silv 56 or equivalent). Each milliohm of joint resistance directly
   reduces efficiency. Regular tin-lead solder adds measurable loss.

2. **Polish tube ends before soldering.** Remove all oxidation with fine
   sandpaper (400 grit) immediately before soldering. Oxide layers increase
   contact resistance.

3. **Minimize the capacitor gap leads.** The copper straps from tube ends to
   capacitor terminals should be < 10 mm long and as wide as the tube OD.
   Use flattened tube ends or copper strap, not wire.

4. **Keep the loop circular** (Loops B and C). Circular loops have lower loss
   than octagons due to uniform current distribution. Loop A can be octagonal
   for structural support — the efficiency penalty is < 0.5 %.

5. **No mechanical-only joints** at high-current points. The entire main loop
   current (up to 5.7 A) flows through every connection. Clamps, set screws,
   and compression fittings all add loss.

### Loop Forming

- **Anneal the tube** before bending: heat to cherry-red with propane torch,
  quench in water. This makes 3/8" tube bend easily without kinking.
- **Loop A (1.6 m):** Octagon, 8 sides × 628 mm. Use a straight-edge jig.
- **Loop B (0.85 m):** Circle, bend around a 33.5" barrel or drum form.
- **Loop C (0.44 m):** Circle, bend around a 17" wheel or bucket.
- Leave a **15 mm gap** at the top of each loop for capacitor terminals.
  Flatten the tube ends and drill for bolted connection.

## Operating Guidelines

| Band | Bandwidth | Retune Interval | Best Modes |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| 30 m | 9.2 kHz | Every 7 kHz | CW, FT8, WSPR, JS8 |
| 20 m | 24.2 kHz | Every 18 kHz | All modes |
| 17 m | 15.1 kHz | Every 12 kHz | All modes |
| 15 m | 23.4 kHz | Every 18 kHz | All modes |
| 12 m | 38.8 kHz | Every 30 kHz | All modes |
| 10 m | 61.3 kHz | Every 50 kHz | All modes inc. FM |
| 6 m | 95.1 kHz | Entire band OK | All modes inc. FM |

> **Retune interval** = approximate SWR < 2:1 window (≈ 75 % of −3 dB BW).

**Digital modes (FT8, WSPR)** are especially effective with this antenna.
FT8 decodes down to −24 dB S/N, so even the 30 m band with 5.4 W ERP can
work worldwide. WSPR at 1 W input → 0.54 W ERP on 30 m is proven for
global propagation monitoring.

**Motor tuning** is optional but nice. The narrowest band (30 m, 9.2 kHz)
is wide enough to cover the FT8 window (10.130–10.140 MHz) or the CW
segment without retuning. A stepper motor helps when moving between band
segments.

## Why This Design Works at 10 W

| Factor | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Circ / λ optimized per band | 54–87 % efficiency (avg 74 %) |
| Three loops, not one | No band has circ / λ < 0.16 |
| 10 W power limit | Vcap < 2 kV → air caps OK, no vacuum parts |
| 3/8" tube | Low Rloss (large surface area for skin current) |
| Silver-soldered joints | Minimizes resistive loss at all connections |
| QRP-friendly bandwidth | 9+ kHz even on 30 m — covers FT8 windows |

A magnetic loop is at its best in the 20 m – 6 m range where the loop
circumference is a significant fraction of a wavelength. By limiting
coverage to 30 m – 6 m and splitting across three optimized loops, every
band achieves over 50 % efficiency — a result that rivals small Yagi
antennas in total system performance when the loop's superior noise
rejection is factored in.
