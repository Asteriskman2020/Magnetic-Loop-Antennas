# ML160-6: Magnetic Loop Antenna System

## 160 m through 6 m — 3/8" Copper Tube Radiator & Coupling Loop

### Design Overview

Covering 160 m to 6 m (1.8–54 MHz) is a **30:1 frequency ratio** — far
beyond any single magnetic loop. The loop circumference must remain between
~0.04 λ and ~0.25 λ for proper small-loop behaviour. This design uses
**three interchangeable main loops** sharing a common vertical mast and
feed system:

| Element | Diameter | Circumference | Bands Covered |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Loop A** (large) | 2.00 m (6.6 ft) | 6.28 m (20.6 ft) | 160 m – 30 m |
| **Loop B** (medium) | 1.00 m (3.3 ft) | 3.14 m (10.3 ft) | 20 m – 15 m |
| **Loop C** (small) | 0.40 m (15.7 in) | 1.26 m (4.1 ft) | 12 m – 6 m |

All main loops and all coupling loops are formed from **3/8" (9.525 mm) OD
soft-temper copper tube (Type L)**.

## Loop A — 160 m through 30 m

### Physical Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Main loop diameter | 2.00 m (6.56 ft) |
| Main loop circumference | 6.28 m (20.6 ft) |
| Tube OD / wall | 3/8" (9.525 mm) Type L soft |
| Loop inductance | 6.82 μH |
| Loop area | 3.14 m² |
| Coupling loop diameter | 400 mm (16 in) — 1/5 ratio |
| Coupling loop circumference | 1 257 mm (4.1 ft) |

> **Construction note:** A 2.0 m diameter loop in 3/8" soft copper tube will
> sag under its own weight. Form it as an **octagon** (8 sides × 785 mm each)
> and support it with a PVC or fibreglass cross-brace frame. Do NOT use metal
> supports within the loop plane.

### Performance Table — Loop A

| Band | Freq (MHz) | C_tune (pF) | Circ / λ | Efficiency | Eff (dB) | −3 dB BW | Q | V_cap @ 100 W |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|----------|----------|------|---------------|
| 160 m | 1.85 | 1 085 | 0.039 | 0.6 % | −22.3 | 1.7 kHz | 1 059 | 2 900 V |
| 80 m | 3.55 | 295 | 0.074 | 5.5 % | −12.6 | 2.5 kHz | 1 394 | 4 600 V |
| 60 m | 5.35 | 130 | 0.112 | 20 % | −7.1 | 3.7 kHz | 1 453 | 5 800 V |
| 40 m | 7.10 | 74 | 0.149 | 40 % | −4.0 | 5.7 kHz | 1 256 | 6 200 V |
| 30 m | 10.1 | 36 | 0.212 | 69 % | −1.6 | 13.3 kHz | 760 | 5 700 V |

> **160 m reality check:** At 1.85 MHz the loop is only 0.039 λ in
> circumference — a fundamental efficiency limit. The antenna radiates
> 0.6 % of input power (−22 dB). It is still useful as a **quiet receive
> antenna** and for **QRP CW** in low-noise environments. For serious
> 160 m TX work, a loop diameter of 5+ m (using larger tubing) is needed.

### Tuning Capacitor — Loop A

Required range: **36 pF** (30 m) to **1 085 pF** (160 m).

**Recommended:** Vacuum variable capacitor **10–1 000 pF** (e.g. Jennings
CSVF-1000, 15 kV rating) **plus** a relay-switched **100 pF / 7.5 kV
doorknob capacitor** in parallel.

| Config | Total C range | Bands |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| Vacuum var only | 10 – 1 000 pF | 30 m, 40 m, 60 m, 80 m |
| Vacuum var + 100 pF fixed | 110 – 1 100 pF | 160 m |

Verification at 160 m: with 100 pF fixed cap engaged, vacuum variable at
985 pF → total 1 085 pF → resonant at 1.85 MHz. ✓

The switching relay must be a **vacuum relay** or HV reed relay rated ≥ 7.5 kV
(V_cap reaches 2 900 V at 100 W on 160 m, but 6 200 V on 40 m with cap only).

## Loop B — 20 m through 15 m

### Physical Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Main loop diameter | 1.00 m (3.28 ft) |
| Main loop circumference | 3.14 m (10.3 ft) |
| Tube OD / wall | 3/8" (9.525 mm) Type L soft |
| Loop inductance | 2.97 μH |
| Loop area | 0.785 m² |
| Coupling loop diameter | 200 mm (8 in) — 1/5 ratio |
| Coupling loop circumference | 628 mm (2.1 ft) |

### Performance Table — Loop B

| Band | Freq (MHz) | C_tune (pF) | Circ / λ | Efficiency | Eff (dB) | −3 dB BW | Q | V_cap @ 100 W |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|----------|----------|------|---------------|
| 20 m | 14.2 | 43 | 0.148 | 48 % | −3.2 | 10.6 kHz | 1 331 | 5 900 V |
| 17 m | 18.1 | 26 | 0.189 | 69 % | −1.6 | 20 kHz | 909 | 5 500 V |
| 15 m | 21.2 | 19 | 0.222 | 79 % | −1.0 | 33 kHz | 652 | 5 100 V |

### Tuning Capacitor — Loop B

Required range: **19 pF** (15 m) to **43 pF** (20 m).

A **butterfly / split-stator air variable capacitor** (5–50 pF) with ≥ 2 mm
plate spacing handles this range. No supplementary fixed capacitor is needed.

For 100 W operation, the 5 900 V peak (20 m) demands a vacuum variable or
wide-gap (≥ 4 mm) air variable. At QRP ≤ 5 W, voltages drop to ~1 300 V.

---

## Loop C — 12 m through 6 m

### Physical Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Main loop diameter | 0.40 m (15.7 in) |
| Main loop circumference | 1.26 m (4.1 ft) |
| Tube OD / wall | 3/8" (9.525 mm) Type L soft |
| Loop inductance | 0.96 μH |
| Loop area | 0.126 m² |
| Coupling loop diameter | 100 mm (4 in) — 1/4 ratio |
| Coupling loop circumference | 314 mm (1.0 ft) |

> The coupling loop uses a **1/4 ratio** (not 1/5) because an 80 mm diameter
> loop would be below the minimum bending radius of 3/8" copper tube (~38 mm
> radius). At 100 mm diameter (50 mm radius) the bend is comfortable.

### Performance Table — Loop C

| Band | Freq (MHz) | C_tune (pF) | Circ / λ | Efficiency | Eff (dB) | −3 dB BW | Q | V_cap @ 100 W |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|----------|----------|------|---------------|
| 12 m | 24.9 | 42 | 0.105 | 30 % | −5.2 | 13 kHz | 1 928 | 5 400 V |
| 10 m | 28.5 | 33 | 0.119 | 41 % | −3.9 | 16 kHz | 1 735 | 5 500 V |
| 6 m | 50.1 | 11 | 0.210 | 83 % | −0.8 | 76 kHz | 655 | 4 400 V |

### Tuning Capacitor — Loop C

Required range: **11 pF** (6 m) to **42 pF** (12 m).

A small butterfly or air variable capacitor (5–50 pF) covers this range.
The same type used for Loop B works here — Loops B and C can **share a
common capacitor mounting** if the loops are designed for quick-swap at
the terminals.

## Combined System Summary

### All-Band Performance at a Glance

| Band | Loop | Freq (MHz) | Efficiency | Eff (dB) | BW (−3 dB) | Practical Use |
|------|------|-----------|------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| 160 m | A | 1.85 | 0.6 % | −22.3 | 1.7 kHz | RX / QRP CW only |

| 6 m | C | 50.1 | 83 % | −0.8 | 76 kHz | All modes inc. FM |

### Frequency ↔ Loop Selection Boundary

```
 1.8 MHz ──────── Loop A (2.0 m) ──────── 10.15 MHz
                                            │
 14.0 MHz ─────── Loop B (1.0 m) ──────── 21.45 MHz
                                            │
 24.9 MHz ─────── Loop C (0.4 m) ──────── 54 MHz
```

Loop A reaches its 0.25 λ circumference limit at ~12 MHz, so it covers 160 m
through 30 m. Loops B and C handle the higher bands where a smaller loop is
physically required.

## Coupling Loop Details

All coupling loops are 3/8" copper tube, co-planar with and centred inside
the main loop at the 6 o'clock position.

| Loop | Coupling Diameter | Tube Length | Ratio | Feed Connector |
|------|------------------|-------------|-------|----------------|
| A | 400 mm (16 in) | 1 257 mm | 1 : 5 | SO-239 (UHF) |
| B | 200 mm (8 in) | 628 mm | 1 : 5 | SO-239 or BNC |
| C | 100 mm (4 in) | 314 mm | 1 : 4 | BNC |

**Feed method:** Solder the coax shield to one end of the coupling loop tube
and the centre conductor to the other end. Mount a bulkhead connector at
the bottom centre of the coupling loop for a clean coax transition.

The coupling loop can optionally be **Faraday-shielded** (slit the outer
tube, insulate the gap) to reduce common-mode current and improve balance.

**Fine-tuning the match:** If SWR is not below 2:1, tilt or slide the
coupling loop slightly out of the main loop plane. Moving it inward
increases coupling (lower impedance); moving it outward decreases coupling
(higher impedance). Adjust for best match at the most-used frequency.

## Power Handling Summary

| Power | Peak V_cap (worst case) | Worst Band | Capacitor Type Required |
|-------|------------------------|------------|------------------------|
| 100 W | 6 200 V | 40 m (Loop A) | Vacuum variable (≥ 10 kV) |
| 50 W | 4 380 V | 40 m (Loop A) | Vacuum variable (≥ 7 kV) |
| 25 W | 3 100 V | 40 m (Loop A) | Vacuum var or wide-gap air (≥ 4 mm) |
| 10 W | 1 960 V | 40 m (Loop A) | High-quality air variable (≥ 2 mm) |
| 5 W | 1 390 V | 40 m (Loop A) | Butterfly / split-stator (≥ 1 mm) |

> V_cap scales as √P. Reducing power by 4× halves the voltage.

single capacitor mount can serve both loops if the loops are designed for
quick-swap at the tube-to-cap terminals.

## Construction Notes

### 1. Forming the Loops

- **Anneal first.** Heat the tube to cherry-red with a propane torch, then
  quench in water. This makes the tube soft and easy to bend.
- **Loop A (2.0 m):** Form as an **octagon** (8 sides × 785 mm). Use a
  jig — clamp a straight edge and bend at 45° intervals. The octagon is
  self-supporting when mounted on a cross-brace frame.
- **Loop B (1.0 m):** Can be formed as a circle around a barrel or large pot.
  An octagon (8 × 393 mm) also works well.
- **Loop C (0.4 m):** Bend around a bucket or 16-inch wheel form.
- Leave a **15 mm gap** at the top of each loop for capacitor terminals.
  Flatten and drill the tube ends for bolted connection to the capacitor.

### 2. Soldering

- Use **silver solder** (not soft/plumber's solder) for all joints.
  Every milliohm of joint resistance costs efficiency.
- Pre-tin both surfaces, use flux-core silver solder, and heat evenly.
- The coupling loop coax connection is especially critical — a poor joint
  here directly degrades SWR and power handling.

### 3. Capacitor Mounting

- Mount the variable capacitor directly across the gap at the top of the
  loop. Keep connecting straps as **short as possible** (< 10 mm).
- Use copper straps (not wire) between the tube ends and capacitor terminals.
- For Loop A: the vacuum variable capacitor housing should be enclosed in a
  weatherproof plastic box mounted at the top of the mast.

### 4. Support Structure for Loop A

          ───┴───  mast / tripod
```

- Use 1" or 1.25" PVC Schedule 40 pipe for the cross-brace.
- Attach the octagonal loop at each vertex with PVC saddle clamps.
- The mast should be at least 2.5 m tall to keep the loop centre > 1.5 m
  above ground for reasonable radiation pattern.

### 5. Quick-Swap System

Design the tube-to-capacitor terminals with **wing nuts** or quick-release
clamps so loops can be swapped in the field. Use the same bolt spacing for
all three loops. The coupling loop plugs into the SO-239 at the base.

### 6. Weatherproofing

- Conformal-coat the capacitor area and relay with silicone spray.
- Use a plastic enclosure (food container, PVC end caps) over the capacitor.
- The copper tube itself weathers well — a green patina forms that does not
  significantly affect RF performance.

## Calculation Basis

All performance values are derived from standard magnetic loop equations:

```
Loop inductance:      L  = μ₀ × R × [ ln(8R/a) − 2 ]
Resonant capacitance: C  = 1 / (4π²f²L)
Radiation resistance: Rr = 31171 × (A / λ²)²
Surface resistance:   Rs = √(πfμ₀ / σ_Cu)
Loss resistance:      Rl = Rs × circumference / (π × tube_OD)
Efficiency:           η  = Rr / (Rr + Rl)
Quality factor:       Q  = 2πfL / (Rr + Rl)
Bandwidth (−3 dB):    BW = f / Q
Capacitor voltage:    Vc = I × X_L  where  I = √(P / R_total)
```

Parameters used:
- R = loop radius, a = tube radius (4.76 mm)
- σ_Cu = 5.8 × 10⁷ S/m (copper conductivity)
- μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m
- A = loop area, λ = c/f

> Capacitor ESR, solder joint losses, and connector losses are NOT included.
> Real-world efficiency will be somewhat lower than calculated, especially
> if connections are clamped rather than soldered.

## Operating Guidelines

| Band | Retune Interval | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| 160 m | Every 1 kHz | Engage 100 pF relay for this band; CW/RX only at 0.6 % eff. |
| 80 m | Every 2 kHz | Useful for CW; SSB marginal (BW = 2.5 kHz) |
| 60 m | Every 3 kHz | Good for digital modes (FT8/JS8) and CW |
| 40 m | Every 4 kHz | First band with comfortable SSB operation |
| 30 m | Every 10 kHz | Excellent performance; digital modes shine here |
| 20 m | Every 8 kHz | Swap to Loop B; solid all-mode performance |
| 17 m | Every 15 kHz | Very good efficiency; wide enough for SSB |
| 15 m | Every 25 kHz | Best efficiency of all HF bands |
| 12 m | Every 10 kHz | Swap to Loop C |
| 10 m | Every 12 kHz | Good efficiency for all modes |
| 6 m | Every 50 kHz | Excellent; wide enough for FM repeater use |

**Motor tuning is essential** for comfortable operation. On 160 m the usable
bandwidth is under 2 kHz — hand-tuning via a long insulated shaft is
impractical for QSO work. A stepper motor with a microcontroller and
rotary encoder provides smooth remote tuning.

---

## Design Limitations & Honest Assessment

1. **160 m efficiency is 0.6 %.** A 2.0 m loop is only 0.039 λ at 1.85 MHz.
   This is useful for quiet receive and QRP CW, but not for ragchewing or
   contesting. A competitive 160 m magnetic loop needs 5–8 m diameter with
   1" or larger tubing.

2. **80 m efficiency is 5.5 %.** Workable for CW and FT8 at 100 W (effective
   radiated power ≈ 5.5 W). The very low noise floor of a magnetic loop
   partially compensates for the TX loss.

3. **Narrowband tuning** on the lower bands means you must retune frequently.
   Without motor-driven tuning, operating below 20 m is tedious.

4. **High capacitor voltage** (up to 6 200 V at 100 W on 40 m) mandates a
   vacuum variable for the large loop. QRP operation (≤ 5 W) drops voltages
   to ~1 400 V, allowing more affordable air-variable capacitors.

5. **The 2.0 m loop needs structural support.** 3/8" tube cannot hold a 2 m
   diameter shape without a frame. The octagon + PVC cross-brace solves this.

6. **Three loops means swapping.** To change between loop sets you must
   physically disconnect and reconnect at the capacitor terminals. The
   quick-swap terminal design minimises this hassle.

7. **Nearby metal** detunes the antenna. Keep all conductive objects at least
   1 m from Loop A and 0.5 m from Loops B / C.
